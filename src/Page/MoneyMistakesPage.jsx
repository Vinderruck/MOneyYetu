        Common Money Mistakes to Avoid – and How to Fix Them
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Many people struggle with money not because they don’t earn enough, but because of{" "}
        <strong>poor financial habits</strong> that slowly drain their income and block growth. 
        Below are the <strong>most common money mistakes</strong> people make — and practical tips 
        on how to avoid them.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">
        1. 🛍️ Overspending Without Tracking
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Impulse buying and spending on unnecessary things (especially via{" "}
        <strong>mobile money or online shopping</strong>) can quickly destroy your savings.
        <br />
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Create a <strong>weekly or monthly budget</strong> and stick to it. 
        Track every expense using a budgeting app, mobile tool, or even a simple notebook.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">
        2. 📉 Living Beyond Your Means
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Using loans or credit to maintain a lifestyle you can’t afford is a quick way into debt.
        <br />
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Live <em>below your means</em>. Focus on needs first, then 
        save and invest before spending on luxuries.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">
        3. 💰 Ignoring Savings & Emergency Funds
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Spending your entire income or waiting to "start saving later" leaves you unprepared 
        for emergencies.
        <br />
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Start small — even saving <strong>5–10% of your income</strong> 
        can add up. Use tools like <strong>chamas, SACCOs, or mobile wallets</strong> to 
        build a saving culture.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">
        4. 🎯 No Financial Goals
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Without goals, money slips away easily because you’re not working toward anything.
        <br />
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Set <strong>short- and long-term goals</strong> (e.g., buying land, 
        starting a business, paying school fees). Let your money have a purpose.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">
        5. ⚠️ Falling for Quick-Money Scams
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Fraudsters promise “easy money” or unrealistic returns to lure victims into 
        <strong>fake investments</strong>.
        <br />
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Always research before investing. If it sounds{" "}
        <em>too good to be true — it probably is</em>. Stick to legit platforms and regulated 
        financial institutions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">
        6. 🧾 Avoiding Budgeting
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Many people think budgeting is stressful or only for the wealthy. In reality, 
        skipping a budget creates money leaks.
        <br />
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Budgeting is a tool for <strong>financial control</strong>. 
        Write down your income and expenses — it empowers you, not restricts you.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">
        7. 🕰️ Delaying Investments
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Waiting until you have “a lot of money” before investing is a mistake that wastes 
        time and opportunities.
        <br />
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Start small. Invest in{" "}
        <strong>low-risk SACCO projects, unit trusts, or table banking</strong>. 
        Learn as you grow and increase investments gradually.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-4 font-semibold text-xl">✅ Summary</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-md">
        Managing money is not about how much you earn — it’s about how you{" "}
        <strong>spend, save, and plan</strong>. By avoiding these{" "}
        <strong>common financial mistakes</strong>, you take real steps toward{" "}
        <strong>financial freedom and stability</strong>.
