        Common Money Mistakes to Avoid – and How to Fix Them
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Many people struggle financially not because they don’t earn enough, but because of <strong>poor money habits</strong> that slowly drain their income and limit growth. Below are some of the most common financial mistakes people make — and how you can avoid them:
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">1. 🛍️ Overspending Without Tracking</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Buying things you don't need or spending impulsively (especially online or via mobile money) can quickly destroy your savings.
        <br/>
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Create a weekly or monthly budget and stick to it. Use tools or even a notebook to track where every coin goes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">2. 📉 Living Beyond Your Means</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Taking loans or using credit to maintain a lifestyle you can’t afford is a fast way to fall into debt.
        <br/>
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Live <em>below</em> your means. Focus on necessities first, then invest or save before spending on wants.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">3. 💰 Ignoring Savings & Emergency Funds</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Waiting to "start saving later" or spending your entire income each month leaves you unprepared for emergencies.
        <br/>
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Start small. Even saving 5–10% of your income can add up. Use tools like <strong>chamas, SACCOs</strong>, or mobile wallets to build a habit.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">4. 🎯 No Financial Goals</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Without goals, it’s easy to waste money because you’re not working toward anything.
        <br/>
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Set short and long-term goals (e.g. buying land, starting a business, paying school fees). Let your money have a purpose.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">5. ⚠️ Falling for Quick-Money Scams</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Scammers promise quick returns (especially online or through fake investments) and target people who want to “get rich fast.”
        <br/>
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Be cautious. Research every platform or investment. If it sounds too good to be true — it likely is.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">6. 🧾 Avoiding Budgeting</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Thinking budgeting is boring or only for rich people is a dangerous mindset.
        <br/>
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Budgeting gives you control. It doesn’t restrict you — it empowers you. Start by writing down your income and expenses.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-semibold text-xl">7. 🕰️ Delaying Investments</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-md">
        Many people wait too long to invest because they think they need a lot of money to start.
        <br/>
        <strong>Fix:</strong> Start with small, safe investments (like unit trusts, table banking, or low-risk SACCO projects). Learn as you grow.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-4 font-semibold text-xl">✅ Summary</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-md">
        Managing money well is not about how much you earn — it's about how you <strong>spend, save, and plan</strong>. Avoid these common traps, and you'll be on your way to financial freedom.
